				<h1>Why this topic</h1>
				<p style="color:black">Terrorism has become one of the most pressing national security threats of the 21st century. Today, the type of terrorist
					attacks ranges from individuals carrying out “loner” attacks, to international terrorist organizations committing homicides,
					to states using armed forces to terrorize civilians. The scale and ferocity of the attacks are unprecedented in human
					history. From our analysis, we can see that no part of the world is immune to the threat of the terrorist attacks. While
					heavily driven by ideology, terrorism is also highly related to major shifts in demographics, tensions among different
					ethnic groups, economic recessions, and incompetent government. These issues are prevalent in all regions of the world.
					Here we present a graphic overview of the major trends in global terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2016. We recognize that
					while there is value in looking at global trends, most of the key trends are largely regional, or even country-specific.
					Therefore, we also provide country-by-country breakdowns to demonstrate the trend of terrorist attacks for each country
					(selected by the user) in the last four decades. Our analysis draws primarily on the START database. We will provide
					the background of the dataset in next paragraph and discuss it in further details in the “Data Quality” section.

				<h1>What is GTD</h1>
				<p style="color:black">The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database containing information on terrorist events around the
					world from 1970 through 2016. The database contains information on over 170,000 terrorist attacks. It is currently regarded
					as the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world. By collecting incident data from over
					4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources, the GTD includes information on more than 83,000 bombings, 18,000 assassinations,
					and 11,000 kidnappings since 1970. The GTD is made publicly available online by The National Consortium for the Study
					of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) in an effort to promote understanding of terrorist attacks.
