				<h2>Accountability</h2>
				<p style="color:black">This document reflects the collection and coding rules for the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), maintained by the National
					Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).The criteria and coding system were designed
					to be completely transparent and available to all future users of the database. As such, the commitment was made to
					describe coding decisions wherever possible.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="wrapper style3">
			<div class="title">Completeness</div>
			<div id="main" class="container">
				<h2>Completeness</h2>
				<p style="color:black">The completeness of this data set has been maximized, but still incomplete. According to GTD, the process begins with
					a universe of over one million media articles on any topic published daily worldwide in order to identify the relatively
					small subset of articles that describe terrorist attacks. The GTD team gathered the articles through a subscription
					to the Metabase Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Moreover Technologies, Inc. These articles are then
					processed using more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to further refine
					the results, remove duplicate articles, and identify articles that are likely to be relevant.In addition, each month,
					GTD researchers at START manually review approximately 16,000 articles and identify attacks to be added to the GTD.</p>
				<p style="color:black">However, the data is still missing one part of the data, as we can see from the line chart. The data of year 1993 was
					excluded from the data set by GTD to prevent misintepreting the data, due to the challenges of retrospective data collection
					for events that happened more than 20 years ago, the number of 1993 cases for which sources were identified is only
					15% of estimated attacks. </p>

			<div class="title">Correctness</div>
			<div id="highlights" class="container">
				<h1>Correctness</h1>
				<p style="color:black">The dataset is correct if used to identify certain part of terrorist attacks throughout the world. However, it still
					has its own limitations. As noted, The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force
					and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion,
					or intimidation. Therefore, there are certain criteria that an incident must satisfy to be documented in this dataset.
					These criteria, as noted by GTD, include:
				</p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal.</p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience
					(or audiences) than the immediate victims.</p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. </p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">However, from these criteria, we can see clearly that every single data was censored manually by the member of GTD, and
					there is always defitional overlapping between terrorism and other types of crime. Therefore, even with the criteria,
					it is hard to say every incident in this dataset is truely qualified as a terrorist attack.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wrapper style3">
			<div class="title">Coherence</div>
			<div id="highlights" class="container">

				<h1>Coherence</h1>
				<p style="color:black">This dataset is quite coherent for several reasons.</p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">First, the source of this dataset, as mentioned, is highly reliable. The original dataset has actually been through several
					modifications, including improving the labelling of the type of terrorist attacks, naming of district, city, country
					and region, re-classifying of several sections due to underutilization, etc. Each year, the coherence of the data set
					will be improved by GTD: New weapon types are added, unknown injuries and fatalities are identified through some evidence,
					etc.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-top:-25px;color:black">Second, by going through several graphs by glance, the results match our expectation quite well. For example, if someone
					wants to identify some key incidents happended in the U.S from the visualization. He will immediately notice the incredibly
					high injuries and fatalities in the year 2001 (as shown in the picture), which is due to the 911 terrorist attack.</p>
